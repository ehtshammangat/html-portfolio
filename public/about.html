<h1>About Myself</h1>
<p>My name is Ehtsham Faraz Mangat. I was graduated as a lawyer from the University of Punjab in 2008 and started as
  an Associate Lawyer in a law firm named as "Ijaz & Ijaz" founded by Mr. Ijaz Chadhar a former Judge and now as a
  senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. I have also worked as a Paralegal in a law firm (Al Shamsi & Partners)
  based in Dubai, UAE till 2016. Then I founded my own law firm inn September 2016 under the brand name "AFM LAW ASSOCIATES."

<p>Belonging to a legal background, I always found myself very keen in taking interest in Arts as I remember it
  used to be my favourite time-pass when I was in school. I used to paint drawings in my free time and I was ver good 
  at it. In my 11th Grade I opted for Computer Sciences as my optional subject and found it very interesting. At that 
  time in class I remember we did C++ and it was very interesting.

<p>This year I decided to switch my profession from Legal Practices to a full stack web-deveoper because I feel
  that my previous profession was not meant for me. I take more interest in computers and love to learn new skills
of modern era and technology. As today we see technology is everywhere and in each and every thing. I have switched
my profession to web-developer as it is not only my hobby but also need of the day and future.</p>
